6. ALPHA MINER ALGORITHM

Alpha Miner is one of the most popular process mining algorithms. It was proposed by Wil van der Aalst, Ton Weijters, and Laura Maruster in 2004. It is a fundamental process discovery algorithm that extracts a process model from an event log consisting of traces and represents it as a petri net. It is based on analyzing immediate successor relation between activities present in the event log.
