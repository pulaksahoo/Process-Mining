To generate process flow diagram for sequential event log,a synthesized event log was taken.Alpha algorithm was implemented.The petrinet was generated using ProM- 6.5.1.

The first step of alpha algorithm is finding the set of unique activities present in the sequential event log. For this step, each activity is to be compared with all the other activities present in the entire event log.The second step is to find the set of all starting events in the entire event log.The third  step is to find the set all end events and the fourth is the generation of foot print matrix.
